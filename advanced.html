<h3>Conversations</h3>
Chel: Hey Toby <br>
Toby:feels good to be back xD <br>
Chel: Lol, ikr, been a while we used atom. or at least, u. I use it daily <br>
Toby:wow,,,well am trying to re-schedule myself to code daily,,,soon tho,,i wanna drop somethings <br>
Chel: Yhh good to know,, so , let me know, what was tough for u in the last vid. <br>
Toby:i think a little bit of further Explanation should do,,,with my hard work,,,reason why its hard is bcuz i havent sat down to check the codes 1 afta d other,,,sorry
are abbreviations allows while chatting,,,,,and can i copy this code you wrote here? <br>
Chel: kk toby,, abbreviations are allowed ofc. And the code is too much to copy,, like i told u ,, github is used best for storing code,, and the way i see it, it's high time ,, u started having codes
on ur profile repo. But dnt worry, i will guide u through. This code on here, is not jst one page, if u notice. There re 5 more pages. Here, we created a few web-pages that's why <br>
Toby:its just one here,,,i guess atom does not allow that,,,or we aint getting it <br>
Chel: Yhh,, i guess,, im currently in a project folder, but u aren't seeing them. At the end I'm planning on pushing the codes to my github, then u can
fork it to ur own repo. Also,, did u get komodo yet? <br>
Toby:ok that will be cool,,,no power gonna download it now. <br>
Chel: Well, yhh,, jst to see how it works, komodo i mean. Bt i dont see us using it soon, u would need to set up an acct n that process alone
is something. <br>
Toby:process??,,,aiit no p den,so we vibe <br>
Chel: Yhh,, I think i spent upto three days, figuring out where i should create an account before being able to
collaborate. They had different websites for it, and one of the websites was under development,, the worst.
Toby:for it to take u 3 days,,am gonna make lots of mistakes lolssss,,,it will take my yrs xD <br>
Chel: Surely not,, bt I'm hoping i can check my mail and trace the email to find the website I received it from, in other to send
to you. But for now,, u can jst download the ide and familarise with it. <br>
Tobi:ok no qualms <br>
Chel: Yhh,, Also , we should go throught all this code but for u to understand in depth,, u would need to look
at it urself also. The main new concept is just Linking between pages to form a collection of webpages <br>
Toby:yeah thats the main issue,,let me glance through <br>
Toby:sorry whats the <div></div> again,,i dont really get its own tag ? <br>
Chel: Div is a tag used for outlining elements structurally. If u want a group of paragraph
tags to be styled together,, u can enclose them with a div tag and instead style "only" the div
and it applies to every thing inside. And note,, not jst p tag, anything can be inside a div tag.  <br>
Toby:yeah i now understand,,does it have a full meaning <br>
Chel: No,, just div ,, that;s the name <br>
Toby:ok let me check out the code <br>
Chel: Is ur html preview on?
Toby:yeah it is,,this once are understandable,,a little practice shud do,,



    <h4>Header Tag and Use</h4>
    <header>
      The main use of the header element is to enclose h1-h6 heading tag inside. It is a semantic or structural tag <br>
      Unlike the h1-h6 tags, <b>It does not make text bold or big.</b> <br>
      Technically speaking, It is used to indicate that this is the head of a document
    </header>

    <h3>Input Tag and it's types</h3>
    <p>The input tag has 6 main different types of data that can be entered in it's field.
    Web browsers and Integrated Dev Environments(IDEs) are modified to understandand react accordingly to the <b>type</b> of an input</p>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Your Name">
    <input type="email" placeholder="Your Email">
    <input type="date" placeholder="DOB">
    <input type="password" placeholder="Your password">
    <input type="url" placeholder="Website Url">
    <input type="number" placeholder="Lucky Number">


    <h3>Navigation Tag and Use</h3>
    A nav tag is used to build a navigation bar that has a lot of links inside it in an orderly structure.
    The most common tags you can find in a navigation tag is the <b>DIV</b> and <b>anchor/linking tag</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Div is used to hold all the text in a enclosed format and make things ordered</li>
      <li>A or anchor tag is used to link to the pages contained in your website</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Video and Audio Tags</h3>
    Video and Audio tags are quite straightforward to use and understand


    <h3>Ways of Adding Colors with Css</h3>
    <p>There are three main ways of adding colors using CSS to an html element
    <ul>
      <li>Using the normal Everyday Color style: Red, Green, Blue, Brown, Black and so on.</li>
      <b>Example</b>
      p{
        color: red;
      }
      <li>Using The Hexadecimal-Values of Adding Color. They are written in the following format: #rrggbb.
        Where rr,gg and bb are values between 00 and ff. rr-the amount of red, gg-the amount of green,bb-the amount of blue.
        00 is the lowest and ff is the highest . #000000 forms black , and #FFFFFF forms white. This method offers more color ranges and combinations
        <b>Example</b>
        p{
          color: #696969;  This would form grayish color when applied to an html element
        }
      </li>
      <li>The last way to give html elements color is using RGBA syntax. This one is more straight-forward than the hex-values
      In rgb, r is red, g is green, b is blue and a is alpha. which means the intensity of the specified color. Do u want it to be totally transparent or
    opaque,, that's what aplha means. it's a number between 0.0 and 1.0. For the rgb values, 0 depicts the lowest intensity and
  255 the highest. The format for writing colors with rgba is rgba(r,g,b,a) where rgb can be any values between0 and 255 and a values
between 0.0 and 1.0.
      <b>Examples</b>
      p{
        color: rgba(255,153,63,0.5)
      }
</li>
    </ul>
    And those are all the ways you can define html colors using CSS.
